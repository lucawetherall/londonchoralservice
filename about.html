        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="lede">The London Choral Service was founded to bring the highest standard of live music to life's most significant occasions.</p>

        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>We believe that the right music, performed with care and skill, has the power to transform a ceremony. A hymn sung well can carry a congregation. A solo voice can hold an entire room in stillness. A choir can lift an occasion from the ordinary to the extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The London Choral Service exists to make that happen. We connect you with exceptional musicians, guide you through the choices, and handle every detail&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;so that on the day, the music is one thing you don't need to worry about.</p>

        <h2>Our musicians</h2>
        <p>Every singer and instrumentalist on our roster has been personally auditioned and selected for the quality of their voice, their musicianship, and their ability to perform with sensitivity in the context of a ceremony.</p>
        <p>Many are graduates of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. Their performance credits include the Royal Albert Hall, St&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the Royal Opera House, the O2&nbsp;Arena, and Wembley Stadium. They have performed at the Rugby World Cup, the Olympics closing ceremony, the Queen's Golden Jubilee, and the coronation of King Charles&nbsp;III.</p>
        <p>We have over 150 singers and instrumentalists on our books, which means we are always available for your date.</p>

        <h2>Where we perform</h2>
        <p>We are based in London but perform throughout the United Kingdom. Our singers have performed in churches, chapels, crematoriums, cathedrals, synagogues, outdoor venues, private estates, hotels, and concert halls.</p>
        <p>If you have a venue in mind, we can advise on the best ensemble size and instrumentation to suit the space and the occasion.</p>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>When you get in touch, we begin with a conversation about your occasion: the venue, the date, the tone you'd like to set, and any music you already have in mind. There is no obligation at this stage.</p>
        <p>From there, we provide a tailored recommendation and a clear quote. Once confirmed, we handle the rest&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;from arranging rehearsals to liaising with your venue or funeral director.</p>
        <p>On the day, our musicians arrive early, set up discreetly, and perform with the professionalism you would expect from some of the country's finest trained singers and players.</p>
