        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="lede">We exist for one reason: to ensure the music at your most important occasion is as good as it can possibly be.</p>

        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>The right music, performed with skill and feeling, transforms a ceremony. A hymn sung with conviction can carry a whole congregation through their grief or joy. A solo voice can hold a room so still you could hear a pin drop. A full choir can lift a moment from the ordinary to something no one in the room will ever forget.</p>
        <p>That is what we do. We listen first, then match you with the right musicians and the right repertoire. We manage every detail&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;rehearsals, sheet music, coordination with your venue&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;so you can focus on what matters. The music on the day becomes something you can rely on completely.</p>

        <h2>Our musicians</h2>
        <p>Every singer and instrumentalist has been personally auditioned. We select for three things: exceptional vocal or instrumental quality, musicianship, and the rare ability to perform with genuine sensitivity during ceremonies&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;because technique alone is not enough when the occasion is deeply personal.</p>
        <p>Most are graduates of the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, and Britain's leading conservatoires. Their credits span the Royal Albert Hall, Westminster Abbey, St&nbsp;Paul's Cathedral, the Royal Opera House, the coronation of King Charles&nbsp;III, and the Olympics closing ceremony. What matters most: they arrive understanding that they're there to serve the moment and the people who've gathered.</p>
        <p>With over 150 musicians on our roster, we can accommodate any date&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;including last-minute bookings.</p>

        <h2>Where we perform</h2>
        <p>Based in London, available nationwide. Our musicians have performed in parish churches, crematoriums, cathedrals, chapels, synagogues, private estates, hotels, concert halls, and outdoor settings of every kind.</p>
        <p>If you already have a venue, we can recommend the ideal ensemble size and instrumentation for the space. If you are still deciding, we are happy to advise.</p>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>It starts with a conversation. Tell us about the occasion&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the venue, the date, the atmosphere you want to create. If you have music in mind, we'll talk about it. If you're unsure, we'll guide you. No obligation, no pressure at all.</p>
        <p>We then put together a tailored recommendation with a clear, written quote. Once you confirm, we handle everything: all rehearsals, sheet music preparation, and full coordination with your venue or funeral director. You won't need to chase us or manage logistics.</p>
        <p>On the day, our musicians arrive early, set up quietly, and deliver a performance that does justice to the occasion and the people gathered.</p>
