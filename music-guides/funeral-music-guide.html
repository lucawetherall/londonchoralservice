          <p class="lede">Choosing music for a funeral is one of those tasks that feels both deeply personal and strangely impossible. You want it to be right. You want it to mean something. And you&rsquo;re often making these decisions while grief has made even simple things feel hard. This guide is here to help&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;not with a list of rules, but with the kind of practical thinking that comes from helping families through this every single week.</p>

          <h2>Start with the person, not the occasion</h2>
          <p>The best funeral music isn&rsquo;t chosen from a catalogue. It comes from thinking about who this person was and what they meant to the people in the room.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the answer is obvious. A lifelong churchgoer will have hymns they loved. A classical music enthusiast might have talked about a particular piece for years. Someone with a dry sense of humour might want the congregation to smile at an unexpected choice. We once had a family choose &ldquo;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&rdquo; as the exit music because their father had quoted it at every possible opportunity. It was perfect&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the whole room laughed through their tears, which was exactly what he would have wanted.</p>
          <p>Other times, nothing springs to mind, and that&rsquo;s completely fine. Most families don&rsquo;t have a ready-made playlist. What helps is to think less about what&rsquo;s &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; for a funeral and more about what would feel true to the person. Were they quiet and reflective, or loud and full of life? Did they love tradition, or would they have wanted something different? That emotional instinct will guide you better than any list.</p>
          <p>If the person left no instructions and you&rsquo;re starting from scratch, that&rsquo;s normal too. Read on&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;there&rsquo;s a structure to a funeral service that makes the choices more manageable than they might seem at first.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <h2>Hymns</h2>
          <p>Hymns are the backbone of most funeral services, and there&rsquo;s a reason for that. They give the congregation something to do together. In a room full of people who may feel helpless, standing up and singing is a small act of solidarity. It matters more than you might think.</p>
          <p>Two or three hymns is standard for a church funeral, sometimes two for a shorter crematorium service. The officiant or minister will usually suggest where they fall in the order of service&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;typically at the beginning, after a reading, and near the end.</p>
          <p>The most commonly chosen funeral hymns tend to be the ones people half-remember from school or church: &ldquo;The Lord Is My Shepherd&rdquo; (Crimond), &ldquo;Abide with Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Day Thou Gavest&rdquo;. These are popular for good reason&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;they have strong melodies that carry a congregation even when voices are shaky, and their words speak plainly about faith, loss, and hope. We have a separate guide to <a href="popular-funeral-hymns.html">the most popular funeral hymns</a> with notes on each one if you&rsquo;d like specific suggestions.</p>
          <p>One thing worth knowing: congregational singing at funerals is often tentative. People are emotional, they may not know the hymn well, and they&rsquo;re reluctant to be the loudest voice in the room. This is where professional singers make an enormous difference. A confident lead from even a single trained voice gives everyone else permission to sing. A small choir of four can transform a hymn from a faltering mumble into something that fills the building and lifts the spirits of everyone present. If strong congregational singing matters to you, it&rsquo;s worth thinking about this. Our <a href="hiring-a-choir.html">guide to hiring a choir</a> covers what to expect from professional singers at a funeral.</p>

        <div class="prose">
          <h2>Solo and choral pieces</h2>
          <p>These are the moments when the congregation sits and listens&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and they tend to be the most emotionally powerful part of any funeral service. A solo voice singing something beautiful in a quiet room can stop time in a way that nothing else quite manages.</p>
          <p>The most requested pieces at funerals include Schubert&rsquo;s <i>Ave Maria</i>, Faur&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>Pie Jesu</i>, Franck&rsquo;s <i>Panis Angelicus</i>, and &ldquo;In Paradisum&rdquo; from the Faur&eacute; <i>Requiem</i>. Each creates a different mood. <i>Ave Maria</i> is warm, tender, and deeply familiar&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;even people with no connection to the Catholic tradition find it moving. <i>Pie Jesu</i> is more openly sorrowful, a direct prayer for rest and peace. &ldquo;In Paradisum&rdquo; has an extraordinary quality of lightness, as if the music is already somewhere beyond grief.</p>
          <p>But the repertoire is far broader than the well-known classics. &ldquo;Locus Iste&rdquo; by Bruckner, &ldquo;God Be in My Head&rdquo; by Rutter, &ldquo;Steal Away&rdquo; arranged for solo voice, Elgar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; performed by a string quartet&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;these are all pieces we perform regularly, and each brings something distinct. There are also beautiful settings of poems by composers like Finzi, Vaughan Williams, and Parry that feel unmistakably English and suit a certain kind of farewell.</p>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re planning a <a href="celebration-of-life-music.html">celebration of life</a> rather than a traditional funeral, the range opens up further still&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;popular songs, jazz standards, and folk music all have a place.</p>
          <p>You can hear our singers perform several of these pieces on our <a href="../listen.html">listening page</a>.</p>

          <h2>Instrumental music</h2>
          <p>Instrumental music does the quiet work of a funeral service. It plays as people arrive and take their seats. It accompanies the entrance of the coffin. It fills the silence during a moment of reflection. It plays as people file out at the end. These aren&rsquo;t the moments anyone plans around, but they shape the atmosphere of the entire service.</p>
          <p>The organ is the traditional choice and still the most common for church funerals. A good organist can set a tone of calm dignity from the first notes and accompany hymns with the kind of authority that holds a congregation together. For crematorium services, a piano often works better&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it&rsquo;s more intimate, and most crematoria have a decent instrument available.</p>
          <p>Harp is increasingly popular and suits both sacred and secular settings. There&rsquo;s something about the sound of a harp in a quiet room that immediately creates a sense of peace. A string quartet brings warmth, richness, and a breadth of repertoire&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;from Bach and Barber to Elgar and beyond.</p>
          <p>Less formal options work too. We&rsquo;ve provided guitarists, pianists playing jazz, and even small folk ensembles for services where the family wanted something that reflected the person rather than the convention. There are no wrong answers here, only choices that feel right or don&rsquo;t.</p>
          <p>One practical note: if you&rsquo;d like to use a recorded track for a particular song&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the person&rsquo;s favourite record, say&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that can usually be mixed in alongside live music. Your funeral director can advise on the venue&rsquo;s audio system, and we&rsquo;re used to working around recorded pieces.</p>

          <h2>Practical considerations</h2>
          <p>The emotional side of choosing music gets most of the attention, but there are practical questions that need answering too. Getting these right early saves stress later.</p>
          <p><strong>Venue.</strong> The building dictates a lot. A large parish church with a pipe organ and good acoustics is a very different proposition from a modern crematorium with a small electronic keyboard. Before you set your heart on a particular piece, it&rsquo;s worth checking what the venue can accommodate. Does it have an organ, and is it in working order? Is there space for musicians? Does the crematorium allow live music at all? (Almost all do, but it&rsquo;s worth confirming.) Your funeral director will know the answers to most of these questions.</p>
          <p><strong>Timing.</strong> A crematorium service is typically 30 to 40 minutes, sometimes shorter. A church funeral tends to run 45 minutes to an hour. This affects how much music you can include. Two hymns and one solo piece is a comfortable fit for a crematorium slot. A church service has more room&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;three hymns, a solo or choral piece, and instrumental music before and after is typical without feeling rushed.</p>
          <p><strong>Coordinating with others.</strong> Your funeral director is the central point of contact for the logistics of the day, and the officiant or minister shapes the order of service. Music needs to fit around readings, tributes, prayers, and the committal. We always liaise directly with the funeral director once booked&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;this keeps things simple for the family rather than adding another set of phone calls to an already difficult week. You can see how our <a href="../services.html">booking process</a> works in practice.</p>
          <p><strong>Budget.</strong> Live music is an additional cost, and it&rsquo;s reasonable to want to know what things cost before you commit. A solo singer is less than a quartet; a quartet is less than a full choir. Our <a href="../pricing.html">pricing page</a> sets everything out clearly, with no hidden fees. We believe families should be able to make decisions based on transparent information rather than finding out the cost only after they&rsquo;ve enquired.</p>

          <h2>You don&rsquo;t have to do this alone</h2>
          <p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far and still feel uncertain, that&rsquo;s understandable. Choosing music under these circumstances is hard, and most people have never had to do it before. There&rsquo;s no reason you should know the difference between Schubert and Franck, or which hymns work best in a crematorium, or how to fit three pieces of music into a 30-minute service.</p>
          <p>This is what we do. We help families choose music for funerals every week, and we&rsquo;re always happy to talk it through&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;no obligation, no pressure, just a straightforward conversation about what might work. Often a ten-minute phone call is all it takes to turn a blank page into a clear plan.</p>
