        <h2>Funerals</h2>
        <p>The right music brings comfort that words alone cannot. Our singers lead congregational hymns with warmth and authority, giving everyone present&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;even those who haven't sung in years&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the confidence to join in. Between hymns, solo pieces and choral works create moments of profound beauty and stillness.</p>
        <p>We coordinate directly with your funeral director and officiant to ensure every note fits perfectly into the flow of the service. If you're unsure what to choose, we'll guide you through the options. We've helped hundreds of families through this, and we understand how much it matters to get it right.</p>

        <h2>Weddings</h2>
        <p>From the processional to the signing of the register, live music turns a ceremony into something genuinely unforgettable. We provide singers and instrumentalists for the service, and can continue through the reception, creating atmosphere for celebration and conversation.</p>
        <p>Our repertoire spans classical, sacred, and contemporary music. If there's a piece you've always imagined hearing on your wedding day&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;whether it's a Bach chorale, a Boyz II Men song, or something unexpected&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we can arrange it for your chosen ensemble. That level of personalisation is what sets the day apart.</p>

        <h2>Memorials &amp; celebrations of life</h2>
        <p>A memorial or celebration of life should reflect the person being remembered&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;their personality, their passions, the feeling their family wants to create. Some choose reflective pieces. Others want joyful, uplifting music. Some want both. We listen carefully and shape the music around your vision.</p>
        <p>We perform in every imaginable setting: ancient churches, modern community halls, private homes, gardens, marquees, and outdoor spaces. If you can hold a gathering, we can provide the music.</p>

        <p>Live music transforms corporate occasions. Whether it's an award ceremony, gala dinner, commemorative service, or carol concert, the right music elevates the atmosphere and creates moments people remember. We work with your event coordinator to ensure perfect timing and tone.</p>
