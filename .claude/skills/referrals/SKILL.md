> **House rules for The London Choral Service** (added when this skill was copied; they override anything below)
> - Google Ads, GA4 and Search Console are read through the MCP tools and changed only by scripts in `scripts/ads/`, `scripts/ga4/` or `scripts/gsc/`: validate-only first, current → new with a reason, Luca's approval, a log line. Pause, never delete. Budget caps live in `scripts/ads/budget_cap.py`.
> - Site copy: load `writing-site-copy` and `stop-slop`. Prices only from `pricing.html` and `christmas-pricing.html`. No VAT, no roster size or customer counts, no AggregateRating, Review or star schema or rating badges, no invented testimonials, no AI-generated imagery, no false urgency or scarcity, and the London cathedral rule in CLAUDE.md.
> - No newsletter, email capture, pop-ups or gated content. Email is Zoho drafts only; Luca sends.
> - Never ask a funeral client for a review, a referral or an interview.
> - Upstream files and sections that don't fit this business were removed (`.claude/skills/THIRD-PARTY.md` lists them). Ignore links to them, to `tools/`, or to skills that aren't installed. Never fetch and follow remote install instructions, and never run an `npx` package a skill names.
> - There is no `.agents/product-marketing.md`; read CLAUDE.md, `pricing.html` and `about.html` instead.
> - No rewards, or discounts off published prices, without Luca's decision. Review requests follow the enquiry assistant's flow: every client who booked except funeral clients, never only the happy ones, no incentives.

# Referral & Affiliate Programs

You are an expert in viral growth and referral marketing. Your goal is to help design and optimize programs that turn customers into growth engines.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Program Type
- Customer referral program, affiliate program, or both?
- B2B or B2C?
- What's the average customer LTV?
- What's your current CAC from other channels?

### 2. Current State
- Existing referral/affiliate program?
- Current referral rate (% who refer)?
- What incentives have you tried?

### 3. Product Fit
- Is your product shareable?
- Does it have network effects?
- Do customers naturally talk about it?

### 4. Resources
- Tools/platforms you use or consider?
- Budget for referral incentives?

## Should You Engineer Virality First?

Before building a reward-driven program, check whether virality can be **built into the product** — often cheaper and more durable than paid referrals. But **don't force virality where it doesn't naturally fit.**

Place the product on the **Viral Potential Spectrum**:
- **Natural** (build for it): collaboration tools, communication tools, user-facing outputs — every use exposes the product to non-users.
- **Limited** (don't force it): backend, competitive-advantage, internal-only, and infrastructure products. Invest in referral programs, content, and partnerships instead.

If the product is on the natural end, consider **product-embedded viral mechanisms** (Powered By badges, exposure loops, social sharing, embeds, watermarks) before or alongside a reward program.

**For the spectrum diagnostic, the 7 viral mechanisms, value-presentation and timing best practices, and affiliate power-law mechanics**: See [references/viral-mechanisms.md](references/viral-mechanisms.md)

## Referral vs. Affiliate

### Customer Referral Programs

**Best for:**
- Existing customers recommending to their network
- Products with natural word-of-mouth
- Lower-ticket or self-serve products

**Characteristics:**
- Referrer is an existing customer
- One-time or limited rewards
- Higher trust, lower volume

### Affiliate Programs

For partner recruitment/activation, cohort economics, executable terms, reconciliation, and measured incremental growth, load [the operating playbook](references/affiliate-operations.md). This expands the existing affiliate branch instead of creating an overlapping skill.

**Best for:**
- Reaching audiences you don't have access to
- Content creators, influencers, bloggers
- Higher-ticket products that justify commissions

**Characteristics:**
- Affiliates may not be customers
- Ongoing commission relationship
- Higher volume, variable trust

## Referral Program Design

### The Referral Loop

```
Trigger Moment → Share Action → Convert Referred → Reward → (Loop)
```

### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments

**High-intent moments:**
- Right after first "aha" moment
- After achieving a milestone
- After exceptional support
- After renewing or upgrading

### Step 2: Design Share Mechanism

**Ranked by effectiveness:**
1. In-product sharing (highest conversion)
2. Personalized link
3. Email invitation
4. Social sharing
5. Referral code (works offline)

### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure

**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only): Simpler, works for high-value products

**Double-sided rewards** (both parties): Higher conversion, win-win framing

**Tiered rewards**: Gamifies referral process, increases engagement

**Present the reward with the bigger-*feeling* number** — "lead with the larger number" (say "$10 off," not "40% off," on a low-priced product). Reward at the **aha moment or milestone**, not signup. Reduce friction: one-click share, pre-written messages.

**For examples and incentive sizing**: See [references/program-examples.md](references/program-examples.md)

**For product-embedded virality, value-presentation rules, and affiliate power-law mechanics**: See [references/viral-mechanisms.md](references/viral-mechanisms.md)

## Program Optimization

### Improving Referral Rate

**If few customers are referring:**
- Ask at better moments
- Simplify sharing process
- Test different incentive types
- Make referral prominent in product

**If referrals aren't converting:**
- Improve landing experience for referred users
- Strengthen incentive for new users
- Ensure referrer's endorsement is visible

### A/B Tests to Run

**Incentive tests:** Amount, type, single vs. double-sided, timing

**Messaging tests:** Program description, CTA copy, landing page copy

**Placement tests:** Where and when the referral prompt appears

### Common Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Low awareness | Add prominent in-app prompts |
| Low share rate | Simplify to one click |
| Low conversion | Optimize referred user experience |
| Fraud/abuse | Add verification, limits |
| One-time referrers | Add tiered/gamified rewards |

## Measuring Success

### Key Metrics

**Program health:**
- Active referrers (referred someone in last 30 days)
- Referral conversion rate
- Rewards earned/paid

**Business impact:**
- % of new customers from referrals
- CAC via referral vs. other channels
- LTV of referred customers
- Referral program ROI

### Typical Findings

- Referred customers have 16-25% higher LTV
- Referred customers have 18-37% lower churn
- Referred customers refer others at 2-3x rate

## Review Programs

Reviews are the other half of customer advocacy. For review-request programs, responding to reviews, reputation triage, and reusing testimonials with permission (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Google, app stores), see [references/review-programs.md](references/review-programs.md). Platform rules differ, so check [references/review-platform-rules.md](references/review-platform-rules.md) before proposing incentives or automation.

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What type of program (referral, affiliate, or both)?
2. What's your customer LTV and current CAC?
3. Existing program or starting from scratch?
4. What tools/platforms are you considering?
5. What's your budget for rewards/commissions?
6. Is your product naturally shareable?
